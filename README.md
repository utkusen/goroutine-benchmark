# goroutine-benchmark

Running concurrent Go routines is an effective way to maximize the performance of multi-core processors. If you have undefined amount of tasks, itâ€™s better to limit number of running go routines with a pool mechanism. However, determining this limit is not straightforward. It usually does not equal to the number of processors and can vary between CPU-related and network-related tasks.

This tool allows you to benchmark your current system to identify the optimal number of go routines. It tests both CPU-related and network-related tasks.

# Installation

## From Binary

You can download the pre-built binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/utkusen/goroutine-benchmark/releases/latest) page and run. For example:

`unzip goroutine-benchmark-linux-amd64.zip`

`./goroutine-benchmark --help`

## From Source

1) Install Go on your system

2) Run: `go install github.com/utkusen/goroutine-benchmark@latest`

# Usage

You can run it with default values

`./goroutine-benchmark`

It will produce a result like:

You can also fine-tune different parameters:

```
  -cpu-steps int
    	Steps to increase Go routine pool size (default 1)
  -cpu-task int
    	Total CPU tasks (default 50)
  -cpu-threshold float
    	Success threshold for CPU-intensive tasks (percentage) (default 1)
  -fib int
    	Fibonacci number to calculate (default 40)
  -http-steps int
    	Steps to increase Go routine pool size (default 5)
  -http-task int
    	Total HTTP requests for each pool size (default 500)
  -http-threshold float
    	Success threshold for HTTP tasks (percentage) (default 1)
  -url string
    	Target URL to send HTTP requests (default "http://example.com")
```
